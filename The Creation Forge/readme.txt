[h1]What does it do?[/h1]
The Creation Forge will create out of nothing everything a dwarf could ever desire. Will create food, materials like adamantine or frozen wood, dragon blood, unicorn meat, armor, weapons, clothes, gemstones, glass, food, drink and even magma (cos it's fun).

Inherently DF is fiendishly difficult to learn and even more so to master. Be it your entry card to break into the game or simply your personal creative mode/sandbox to play around, build that cool [url=https://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Mega_construction]mega construction[/url] or check out the [url=https://dwarffortresswiki.org/index.php/Underworld]HFS[/url] this mod will help with it.

By now over 900 reactions grouped into multiple categories. Supports creation of single items, stacks of tens or hundreds at once. Also you can have your dwarves train their skills at a greatly accelerated pace.

The mod now contains prepared code blocks to make it easily compatible with some of the bigger mods out there, ie. Dark Ages V, The Aeramore Expansion and New Genesis (Volume II) (check the file entity_patch_creationforge.txt).

[b]Note:[/b] Adding things like skulls, bones, shell and the like still seems to be not possible as we lack the proper tags to do so. Anybody has other information or figured it out please let me know! Meanwhile create yourself a lobster, a turtle or a crab instead.

[h1]What to keep in mind[/h1]
[b]Important:[/b] Any mod MUST be added to the load list at time of world generation! Cannot be dropped in the middle of a running game / already generated world!

[b]An update [u]requires[/u] a new word to be generated [u]if[/u] you want to make use of the changed/added reactions. Existing worlds will simply not have the new reactions available for use.[/b]
Furthermore the [url=http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=29157.0]Common Question: When do I need to generate a new world?[/url] is answered on the DF forums.
